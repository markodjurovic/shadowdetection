#summary Expand/Reduce framework with new/existing features

= Use other features = 

  If you need different set of features than current set you can put in process easily in only three steps:
  * Implement new class derived from class IImageParameteres (defined in src/cpp/core/tools/image/IImageParameteres.h)
  * In function createImageParameters (defined in src/cpp/util/ParametersFactory.h implemented in ParametersFactory.cpp) change return type to return your class. Something like:
{{{
        IImageParameteres* createImageParameters(){
            return new YourNewParameterClass();
        }
}}}
  * Rebuild project configuration you use

  I know that this is not good solution so soon it will be enabled some simple RTTI which will provide enabling of new class through configuration file.
