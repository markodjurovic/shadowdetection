= News =
  * Version 0.1.0 
    # Added OpenCL processing support (see [ShadowDetection#Requirements Requirements])
    # Added batch processing (see [ShadowDetection#Config Config])
    # Added configuration (see [ShadowDetection#Config Config])
= Requirements =
  == Supported operating systems ==
     * Linux 64 bit
  == Supported CPUs ==
     *x86_64
  == Supported image formats ==
     * jpeg
     * tiff
     * png
  == Required libraries ==
     * libjpeg and dev ( [http://libjpeg.sourceforge.net libjpeg] )
     * libtiff and dev ( [http://www.libtiff.org/ libtiff] )
     * libpng and dev  ( [http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html libpng] )
     * OpenCV 2.4.9 or above (if openCV is installed with different prefix than /usr/local then must set adequate include and lib paths)
     * make
     * g++
     _Notice: Some libraries have them own requirements_
  == OpenCL ==
    === Supported device hardware ===
        * NVIDIA GeForce 600 series or above
        * NVIDIA Tesla K series
          _Notice: May work on some other NVIDIA cards than specified but it is not tested_          
    === Supported host hardware ===
        * Intel CPUs
        * AMD CPUs
    === Required software ===
        * Latest NVIDIA OpenCL capable drivers
        * NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit v6 (if cuda toolkit is installed at different location than /usr/local/cuda-6.0/ then must set adequate lib and include paths)
        * OpenCV built with WITH_OPENCL turned ON

= Config =
Configuration file is: ShadowDetectionConfig.xml and looks like this:
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<QsConfig>
    <process>
        <UseBatch>
            true
        </UseBatch>        
    </process>
    <settings>        
        <openCL>            
            <platformid>
                0
            </platformid>
            <deviceid>
                0
            </deviceid>       
        </openCL>        
    </settings>
</QsConfig>
}}}

"UseBatch" variable should have true/false value. 
  * If it is true then specify file with list of images should be processed ( look [ShadowDetection#Usage Usage] )
  * If it is false then specify input image file and output file with extension

"platformid" specifies platform index used in openCL processing

"deviceid" specifies device index of selected platform used in openCL processing

= Usage =
  == Build ==
    === NetBeans ===
      This is netbeans 8.0 project. If you are using this version or above just open it from File->Open Project. If required dependecies are not installed at default locations, you got to set adequate include and lib dirs in project properties.
    === Command line ===
      make usage:
{{{
Makefile Usage:"
	make [CONF=<CONFIGURATION>] [SUB=no] build"
	make [CONF=<CONFIGURATION>] [SUB=no] clean"
	make [SUB=no] clobber"
	make [SUB=no] all"
	make help"
}}}
      Configurations are: Debug, Release, DebugOpenCL, ReleaseOpenCL.
      If required dependecies are not insatlled at default locations, you got to set adequate lib and include dirs in make files.
